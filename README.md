# Deep Learning System

This is a "mini Torch". We design and build from scratch a complete deep learning library, capable of efficient GPU-based operations, automatic differentiation of all implemented functions, and the necessary modules to support parameterized layers, loss functions, data loaders, and optimizers. Using these tools, we then build several state-of-the-art modeling methods, including convolutional networks for image classification and segmentation, recurrent networks and self-attention models for sequential tasks such as language modeling, and generative models for image generation.
